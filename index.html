        <p>
            <br> I am currently seeking new opportunities. I come from a background in Real Estate and studied at Trine University
            where I am pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a major in Sport Management. While
            there I was involved in many organizations , such as the football team (1 year, soccer team (3 years), Kappa
            Sigma Fraternity, Collegiate Entrepreneurs'â€‹ Organization, American Marketing Association, Student Activities
            Board, and Student Government. While attending Trine I was offered a job with one of the top real estate teams
            in the area which I took. I was offered full time employment and as it was a great opportunity I accepted. As
            a result I did not partake in an internship and did not meet that requirement of that degree. I recently left
            that job and moved to Austin, Texas to attend a coding bootcamp.
            <br>
            <br> I would love to get into the technology field. I have started a full stack coding bootcamp at UT Austin in order
            to gain the necassry skills to be in the tech field.I plan on completing a Swift course for iOS apps after the
            bootcamp to further my skillset.
            <br>
            <br> I was born in Mexico and moved here when I was 7 years old. I grew up playing sports and sports is something
            that is in my life everyday, whether it is watching a sporting event or discussing it with my friends. I am also
            a social media junkie. Social media is a tool that can be very effective in the business world therefore I am
            working to learn more about using it as a professional tool. I am the person that if I do not know something
            I must go look up the answer or solution right away. I try to fix the problem myself before I go ask for help
            unless I know someone can do it more effectively. I am a team player who puts the team's goal as my main focus
            and will work hard to meet and exceed those goals.
